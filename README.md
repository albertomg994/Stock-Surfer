# ImaginChallenge 2016 - WallaTeam

Proyect presented during the ImaginChallenge 2016, by the Team WallaTeam.

## Description

The objective of this game is to get the most points "surfing" the graphs of stocks of the different companies chosen by the user. 

There are two ways to earn points in this game:

1 - Keeping the surfer above the white horizontal line.
2 - Getting bonus items (stars), and avoiding penalty ones (sharks).

Change wisely between the "waves" of the stocks of the selected companies, so that you always keep as high as possible.
You will only be able to see the data of the company that you are surfing in, so you will have to use your knowledge about the stocks of these companies and the relationships between them to choose the one that will lead you to success. 
Every day you will have the possibility to try and unlock new companies as well as buy bonus items.
